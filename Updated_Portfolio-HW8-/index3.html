Welcome! My name is Rissa Crawford. I am a recent graduate from the University of Oregon Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. Although my original line of work dealt mainly in hospitality, this transition into full stack development has been amazing. I am excited to combine my love of caring for people and my attention to detail to become an amazing and dedicated Full Stack Web Developer.
